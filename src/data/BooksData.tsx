        review: "The book started out fascinating, providing a glimpse of how young McConaughey was like before all the fame. His exchange program to Australia was filled with accounts of grit and character. The beginning of his acting career showed exciting adventure. When the book started discussing his times as an established actor, the story started sounding too guarded, as if trying to preserve his current image and industry relations.\n\nPersonally, I was looking forward to hearing more about his acting-related career, preparations, process, and adventures, but McConaughey instead focused on stories that aren't as relevant to his career and with individuals who no longer matter in his life, which felt calculated and like he wasn't really giving the readers his real stories. It felt like there were two McConaugheys in the book as his younger year and his actor years seemed a bit disjointed by the end. His attempt at one-liner wisdoms on life weren't very insightful."

        review: "This book changed the way I think about my reading experience. I used to think that I should be able to enjoy a book the most on the first read, but having pushed myself through the whirlwind of different perspectives and narrative styles, I now believe that I'll enjoy the book better on subsequent reads. It's also become one of the few books I'm excited to read multiple times.\n\nFaulkner uses language to create the sounds and the furies that encompass the eclectic Compsons. Each passage and chapter on its own is just as beautiful and rewarding to read as piecing together the whole story. I personally loved Quentin's chapter the most for its poignancy and subtlety."

        review: "It's a harrowing, fascinating in-depth analysis of the Galvins' psychological development and meltdown through the years. It's emotionally draining as I could not find one thing to place blame on, I could only see a fine line between abuser and victim, and there didn't seem to be a happy ending for the suffering family. I can't imagine how much of a nightmare it must've been for the youngest children to see their older siblings act out in violence, aggression, and abuse.\n\nIt's both encouraging and disheartening to think about how much understanding of an illness or lack there of can make such a huge impact on the lives of people. Kolker opens another door with the storyline of the researchers' works to give the readers a glimmer of hope that something positive can come out of this tragedy. It was an amazing account of Kolker brining out the human elements behind the responses, decisions, and denials that the family members make through each episode."

        review: "The story was strong in the first half with Ashoke and Ashima facing challenges of immigrant, marriage, and parenting life, and Gogol facing challenges of growing up as a second generation immigrant in America, dislike for his name, and juggling the find his place between Indian and American cultures. Lahiri made an interesting choice to give the main character Gogol a humorous name, in order for readers who haven't experienced that immigrant-specific culture clash and identity issue to be able to relate to the story and introspect their own identity and place.\n\nThe second half with Gogol's adulthood felt like the story ran out of steam, as if Lahiri wasn't sure how to continue or end the story. As soon as Gogol's parents became less involved in the story, I felt the story lost tension between cultures and generations. I personally think it had the potential to be a really great book had Lahiri expanded upon Gogol's childhood and ended the story before he became an adult."

        review: "The gradual decent into savagery, evil, and violence and the raw terror that characters inflict on each other reminded me quite a bit of Patrick Süskind's Perfume. It's important that the characters are children, because it shows us that they start out with good intentions. Things take a tragic turn with continuous disagreements and change of power. The ways that the children escalate, belittle, usurp, prey, cry, enforce, obey, and hurt show the extent of the horror that these small-bodied children can be capable of.\n\nIt isn't important to me whether every group of small boys would act this way - it's relevant and thought-provoking that Golding creates a cast of consistent, realistic characters that make us believe this could very well happen. This story makes me think about how someone/something becomes a beast and where the real danger comes from when trapped in a difficult situation with one's life on the line."

        review: "The whole book is written with such fine detail and with characters that I felt like I knew in real life by the end. I don't think there was much glorification of the killers or exaggeration of the events, which helped to show the events as happening between real people in a real town with real consequences. It was interesting to see the detectives' side of the story and how much pressure they received to solve such a difficult case.\n\nGreat introduction to reading a nonfiction novel; it makes me want to try write one. It's evident that Capote did careful research and wrote with a respectful, but precisie tone and prose. The book felt a bit slow towards the middle-end following the journey of Perry and Dick, but it never lost tension."

        review: "A lot of things happen through a seemingly tenuous thread, but Vonnegut masterfully holds the story and characters together for an absurd, subdued punch line at the end. I really enjoyed how the question of humanity's free will was explored with the control of Trafalmadore on Earth on the bigger picture, while the question of individual's free will was explored with Unk's capture, subversion, and escape from Mars.\n\nWe see so much damage being caused by the constant examples of control and manipulation over each other. It's also ironic how Salo the robot feels compassion, while we don't see many examples of compassion from the humans in the book.\n\nThrough making the reader empathize with Malachi Constant, the story shows us that while there are tragedies, pain, reversal of fortune, and accidents in this world, we shouldn't forget what makes us human and strive to find meaning and compassion within ourselves."

        review: "Great book that is both entertaining and eye-opening. It's easy to think of systematic racism as being similar in different parts of the world, but Noah does a great job of showing the unfamiliar readers the inner workings of apartheid through his childhood stories, and not through a history lesson.\n\nThe different 'crimes' - Noah's birth, Abel's violence, Noah's hustling, Patricia's hiding of Noah - are different in magnitude and severity, and show us how perspective and law depend on whoever has the power. His perspective and accounts on how speaking someone's language can make them accept you more readily was powerful. South Africa has 11 official languages, which is different from how America has different cultures but still has just one, unifying official language of English, so being able to speak multiple languages would be much more important in South Africa.\n\nI only wish that Noah provided a bit more of timeline details, since the story jumped from year to year depending on the theme of each chapter. I wish I could have had a better sense of how Noah grew up chronologically. I can see Noah writing another book about the start and rise of his career when he's a bit older and possibly making this a series."

        review: "The premise was interesting, but the connection between Hamnet's death and the play Hamlet was weak. The characters were set up well, but were never fully developed or explored. There were a few engaging passages, such as the flea travelling and Agnes's viewing of Hamlet, but the story overall felt too controlled. I didn't see or feel enough of Hamnet or Agnes or Shakespeare. The book failed to convice me 'why' the connection to the play and the story mattered. It might as well have been about any other family in 16th century England. It could've worked better as a short story perhaps."

        review: "This book explores Harry's psychology in great depth, which I'm finding is Rowling's biggest strength as a writer. We see immaturity in his frustration and in his lack of understanding and impatience with the 'adults', especially Dumbledore. Harry's inner thoughts take the main stage as he struggles to control his doubts and fears about himself, which everyone goes through in their teenage years.\n\nAt the core, this book is a pyschological exploration of a teenager who's transitioning from childhood to adulthood, with the wizarding world providing the background to tell the story in. It's also interesting that Ron becomes largely forgotten as Hermione takes the role of Harry's main sidekick, almost as if Rowling couldn't think of a use for Ron in this book. At the same time, it also shows how relationships go through ups and downs at this stage in life."

        review: "Written in a very raw and visceral, but beautiful way, this book left me with goosebumps. The descriptions of the scents and perfume-making practices, of Grenouille's disturbing and obssessive thoughts, of the way Grenouille process the world through his olfactory senses are all detailed in a very gripping prose. Süskind develops a character who is absolutely remorseless and survives on basic human instincts (particularly his sense of smell), yet his single-minded determination and perseverance to create the perfect scent made me both intrigued and root for him in a twisted way."

        review: "It's a disheartening story told from the point of view of the child narrator Claudia. This narrative perspective put me in a helpless position as the reader, as the unfolding story slowly portrays a bleak future for these children, because of the cyclical tragedies of each generation and the characters' conviction that they're not beautiful, smart, strong, or worthy. Morrison humanizes each character, while not excusing them from their actions.\n\nThe way Morrison ties in conflicts between beauty vs ugliness, abuse and violence within family home, sexuality and rape, and the disconnect between white and black communities shows me how complex and deeply-ingrained in society the challenges a black female growing up in America faces."
