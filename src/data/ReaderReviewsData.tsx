I listened to the audiobook and his narration is absolutely fantastic.\n\nOnly reason I knocked off a star is because I wasn’t a huge fan of the self-help parts of this book.",

            comment: "A rambling book with great stories but flawed execution.\n\nThe good parts are very good--he is a gifted storyteller and this is one of the rare Hollywood memoirs that has a lot of great personal stories in it. Most of them occur before he becomes famous, but halfway through the book something changes. He goes from an average guy to a movie star, and that's when the book (and possibly his personal character) starts to fall apart.\n\nIf you're looking for insights into his movies you won't find any here. He just lists most of them, more interested in his life experiences.",

            comment: "This is a book that unfolds like nothing I’ve ever read. We're sort of lost for the first 70-100 pages. Our understanding of time as a linear process will confound your experience with the first section of the book. Benjy’s narrative is difficult to be sure, but when the book is said and done, his is the most memorable and maybe the most important. In all, the book is divided into four sections with four different viewpoints. We see through Benjy the past, present, and future existing on a plane rather than a line; Quinton's inability to accept time’s passing at all and his longing for the past (a past he was not necessarily a part of); Jason living only in the present and obsessing over an up to the minute existence; and finally Dilsey who seems the only member of the household with the ability to absorb the past as a part of the here and now, and lives without fear the future. This theme is explored through style. It’s like reading a dream. 5 stars.",

It's a heavy and dense one that took me a while to read. It wasn't one I wanted to pick up and read, but it was a book about a family I wanted to understand.\n\nAs devastating as the Galvin's story is, it is also a hopeful one for understanding more about schizophrenia learned from the family. My heart broke for the time lost for the family but hopeful for the living families' future.",

            comment: "This novel gave me a new understanding of just how hard it is to assimilate into a new culture. The first half of the book I remained emotionally unconnected to the characters, felt it was more tell than show. This changed after a family tragedy which afforded an opportunity for the characters to change as well. Was impatient with Gogol and his failure to appreciate everything about his parents, his own culture but he grows within the story as does his mother. So I ended up appreciating this book quite a bit as a cultural story and a family story.",

            comment: "While I admit that the story is thought-provoking and a classic, a pioneer of the subject, I cannot say I enjoyed reading it too much. Not much happens for most of the book and when it does it feels rushed. Also, the author spent a lot more time describing the nature than the characters or their experience. I had problems distinguishing between the children and I did not manage to form a strong opinion either about the positive characters or the negative ones. Finally, I think it did not age well, it is hard to explain why I have this impression.",

The way it was written was just so perfect and fitting - incredibly suspenseful and matter of fact, but still with a touch of emotion.\n\n I'm sure he would have had lots to tell about his whole journey of interviewing and research for the book and I'm sure it would have been interesting as well. HOWEVER, it would have been ill-fitting and inappropriate in a book about such a serious topic. Capote concentrated on what's important - why and how these murders were committed and who the killers and, more importantly, who the victims were. The whole thing just seemed really respectful, everyone got the amount of time and space they deserved.",

While at times this had its advantages, for the most part, it left him on the outside looking in, having to handle everything on his own, fight his own battles, struggle to find people who genuinely liked him for who he was and not the novelty of his skin color, and rebel against a mother who only wanted him to behave.\n\nI enjoyed this book and learned a lot about apartheid, which I really didn't know much about. Noah is a good writer, and delivered his narrative much as I've heard him deliver his lines on The Daily Show.",

            comment: "The first three-quarters of this novel completely captivated me – the atmosphere, the pacing, the shadow hovering overhead. “There is a sensation of change, an agitation of air, as if a bird has passed silently overhead.” The exploration of both a mother and a father’s grief is handled with the care and knowledge of what I am certain comes from O’Farrell’s own experiences. I have read her memoir, I Am, I Am, I Am: Seventeen Brushes with Death. She understands foreboding, fear, and heartache. She writes what she knows with clarity. What I missed, however, was a complete connection to her words. I’ve been trying to pinpoint what exactly lacked for me here. I have certainly been a blubbering fool over the last few novels I’ve read, but not this one! I should have been weeping buckets! Perhaps it is the third person point of view in this one, compared with her memoir which wholly succeeded in baring O’Farrell’s heart and soul to the reader. I went into this one expecting the same. Had I not read the other first, I suspect I would have had a bigger soft spot for Hamnet. But don’t let that stop you from picking this up. It’s worthy of your time and a very fine work of historical fiction – never trite and altogether unique.",

We witness how powerful Dumbledore's abilities are the clear distinctions between Voldemort's death eaters and Dumbledore's army. The end makes it challenging for me to finish the entire book even after all these times because I know what is coming. Looking forward to books 6 and 7 which I enjoy much more than this one.",

Sure, there were some tough parts earlier on, and while it's true that some darkness crept into the ending of the previous installment, for the most part, that was a pretty happy book compared to this. This book grows up. Where the previous four could be labeled as children’s stories, this one cannot. There are so many hard lessons and difficult themes in this, ones that a child’s mind cannot fully grasp. Gone are the heroes, gone are the happy endings.",

I understand that he went through a whole lot after the events of Goblet of Fire but he was moody and a jerk to everyone around him 98% of the time and although I can empathize with him, it became too over the top for me and I got tired of it real fast. He just kept snapping and going off on all the wrong people and it got really annoying. On top of that, I know this was intentional, but I just couldn't keep reading about Umbridge.",

It's set in a bygone period, but it doesn't play with history, so it's not Historical Fiction. It's about a murder, yet it's not terrifying like Horror, nor is it a mystery. It's just the story of a peculiar boy who became a dangerous and most interesting man. He was born without an odor, you see, and lacking that part of identity, became obsessed with smell. That identity crisis triggers philosophical, religious and morbid chords in the book, yet none dominate. If anything, a dark curiosity dominates it. The book has a slightly menacing monotone about it that is almost hypnotic, and lays a surreal lens over the brilliant and crisp descriptions Suskind provides for his world. It's an angry, dangerous little book that baffled literary critics and inspired Nirvana. Read it and label it for yourself.",

'Is she saying what they did was okay?! Is she telling us they weren't to blame and we should feel sorry for them?!' I remember writing my 'objective' and 'tone-neutral' in-class essay while trying to stifle my own feelings of resentment.\n\nI know now that the answers to those two questions were no and no. What Morrison wanted us to do was not pardon the terrible acts of her characters, or brush them off as 'simply tragedy' but to understand where these characters came from psychologically, and what made them the the way they are. People are driven by motivations, sometimes selfless, sometimes self-serving, and sometimes cruel. When I think about this now, I'm absolutely floored.I don't think any work of fiction has ever taught me this huge a lesson about human nature than this one.",
